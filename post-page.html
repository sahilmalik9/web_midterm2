      Proteins are made up of long chains of amino acids, which are organic compounds containing an amine group (-NH2), a carboxyl group (-COOH), and a unique side chain specific to each amino acid. There are 20 different amino acids commonly found in proteins, and their sequence determines the protein's structure and function.

      <p class="post-text">
        Proteins are primarily composed of 20 different amino acids, which are the fundamental building blocks, linked together by peptide bonds. These amino acids include essential ones like histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine, which must be obtained from the diet, and non-essential ones like alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine, proline, serine, and tyrosine, which the body can synthesize. Key elements found in proteins include carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. Additionally, proteins may require cofactors such as metal ions (magnesium, zinc, iron), coenzymes (often derived from vitamins), and prosthetic groups (like the heme group in hemoglobin) for their proper function. After synthesis, proteins often undergo post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, glycosylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation, which further regulate their activity and interactions.
