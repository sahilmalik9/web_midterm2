        <p class="post-text">
          The aim of protein powder is to provide a convenient and efficient source of high-quality protein to support muscle growth, repair, and overall health, particularly for individuals with increased protein needs such as athletes, bodybuilders, and those with active lifestyles. It serves as a dietary supplement to help meet daily protein requirements, enhance muscle recovery after exercise, and improve overall protein intake, especially for those who may struggle to obtain sufficient protein from whole foods alone. Protein powder is also designed to be easily digestible and quickly absorbed, making it an ideal option for pre- and post-workout nutrition or as a meal replacement to support weight management and muscle maintenance.
